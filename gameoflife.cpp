    List of rules:
        1. A location that has zero or one neighbors will be empty the next generation. If a cell was in that 
        location, it dies of loneliness.
        2. A location with 2 neighbors is stable, if it was empty it remains empty the next generation and if it wasnt
        it will remain that way in for the next generation.
        3. A location with 3 neighbors will contain a cell in the next generation. If it was unoccupied before a new cell 
        will be born. If it already had a cell there, the cell remains - good times!
        4. A location with 4 or more neighbors will be empty in the next generation, if there was a cell there already - it dies 
        of overcrowding.
        5. The births and deaths that transform one generation to the next one must all take place simontanously ....
        yada yada, tldr - have one grid for the previou gen and have one for the next gen so that the next gen can be "built"
        from the last gen without destroying it you get what i mean....I hope.
